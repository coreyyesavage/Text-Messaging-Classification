# Text-Messaging-Classification
Is the text spam or not?

## Introduction
Since 2009, text message usage in the United States has increased exponentially to roughly two trillion texts per year. 
When comparing those numbers to phone calls and emails, the statistics become even more staggering. People in the United 
States send and receive five times as many text messages as they do phone calls [1]. Eighty-two percent of text messages 
are read within five minutes while only 1 out of 4 emails received are opened [1]. These numbers are very important, and 
they continue to trend towards more text message usage. Text messaging is no longer used for communication between friends 
and family only, it has also become common place for businesses and advertising. One inconvenient part of that advertising has
been the usage of text messaging for spam. Spamming is the use of a messaging system to send unsolicited messages to large 
numbers of recipients for the purpose of commercial advertising. With spam becoming so popular through text messaging, 
consumers need ways to filter out the spam.  This report is going to explain the analysis completed for the purpose of 
examining spam filtering through the use of machine learning algorithms. 

## Data Description
The dataset used in this analysis was taken from the website www.kaggle.com [2]. The data is compiled on Kaggle; however, 
it is gathered from the University of California, Irvine. The set contains 5,571 rows (instances) and 2 columns (attributes). 
The 2 columns are: text message and category (spam or ham). Spam texts are listed as spam while non-spam messages are listed 
as ham. Each instance represents a separate text message.

## Technology
Python 3.7
